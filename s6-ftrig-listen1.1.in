.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm s6-ftrig-listen1
.Nd subscribe to an
.Xr s6-fifodir 7 ,
then spawn a program, waiting for a pattern of events to occur on the
fifodir
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Ar fifodir
.Ar regexp
.Ar prog...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
acts just as
.Xr s6-ftrig-wait 1 ,
except it can make sure that the process sending the notifications is
actually started after there is a listener for those events.
.Pp
.Nm
subscribes to
.Ar fifodir .
.Pp
It then forks and execs
.Ar prog...
with all its arguments.
.Pp
It waits for the series of events received on
.Ar fifodir
to match
.Ar regexp .
.Ar regexp
must be an extended regular expression.
.Pp
When the series of read events matches
.Ar regexp ,
.Nm
prints the last event it received (one byte) to stdout, then exits 0.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width x
.It Fl t Ar timeout
If the events on
.Ar fifodir
have not matched
.Ar regexp
after
.Ar timeout
milliseconds, print an error message on stderr and exit 1.
By default,
.Nm
waits indefinitely for a matching series of events.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following sequence of shell commands has a race condition.
.Pp
In terminal 1:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
s6-mkfifodir /tmp/toto
s6-ftrig-wait /tmp/toto "message"
.Ed
.Pp
Then in terminal 2:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
s6-ftrig-notify /tmp/toto message
.Ed
.Pp
Depending on the operating system's scheduler, there is the
possibility that the
.Xr s6-ftrig-notify 1
process starts sending
.Dq message
.Em before
the
.Xr s6-ftrig-wait 1
process has actually subscribed to
.Pa /tmp/toto ,
in which case the notification will be missed.
The following sequence of shell commands accomplishes the same goal in
a reliable way, without the race condition:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
s6-mkfifodir /tmp/toto
s6-ftrig-listen1 /tmp/toto "message" s6-ftrig-notify /tmp/toto message
.Ed
