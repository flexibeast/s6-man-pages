.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb
.Nd decompile a CDB database containing a ruleset suitable for
.Xr s6-ipcserver-access 1
or
.Xr s6-tcpserver-access 1
and that has been compiled with
.Xr s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs 1 .
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar dir
.Ar cdbfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
decompiles the CDB file
.Ar cdbfile
into the directory
.Ar dir ,
then exits 0.
.Pp
.Ar dir
must not exist prior to the decompilation.
.Pp
.Ar dir
must be considered a work in progress as long as
.Nm
is running. It is only safe to use
.Ar dir
as a ruleset once the program has exited.
.Pp
If
.Nm
fails at some point, the partial arborescence at
.Ar dir
is removed. However, this doesn't happen if
.Nm
is interrupted by a signal.
.Pp
After the program successfully completes, if
.Ar cdbfile
was a suitable candidate for the
.Fl x
option of
.Xr s6-ipcserver-access 1
or
.Xr s6-tcpserver-access 1 ,
then
.Ar dir
will be a suitable candidate for the
.Fl i
option of the same program, implementing the same ruleset.
