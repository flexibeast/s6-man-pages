.Sh NAME
.Nm s6-tai64n
.Nd read from stdin and write to stdout, prepending lines with a TAI64N timestamp and a space
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
exits 0 when it sees the end of stdin.
If there's an unfinished line,
.Nm
processes it, adds a newline character to it, and writes it before
exiting.
.Pp
.Nm
does neither
.Dq line buffering
nor
.Dq block buffering .
It does optimal buffering, i.e. it flushes its output buffer every
time it risks blocking on input.
Every filter should behave this way, whether its output is a tty or
not: it's simpler and more efficient in every case.
