.Sh NAME
.Nm s6-fdholder-transferdump
.Nd connect to two separate
.Xr s6-fdholderd 1
daemons and transfer the content of the first one to the second one
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.\" '-T lint' reports "WARNING: skipping no-space macro",
.\" but the rendered output is correct.
.Op Fl t Ar timeoutfrom : Ns Ar timeoutto
.Ar pathfrom
.Ar pathto
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
connects to an
.Xr s6-fdholderd 1
server process listening on
.Ar pathfrom
and gets the whole set of file descriptors from this server, with
their identifiers and (when relevant) expiration dates.
.Pp
It then connects to a different instance of
.Xr s6-fdholderd 1 ,
listening on
.Ar pathto ,
and stores the set of file descriptors in it.
The set is added to the second server, which keeps the descriptors it
was already holding.
.Pp
Dumping the entire state of
.Xr s6-fdholderd 1
requires special authorizations.
Make sure the
.Xr s6-fdholderd 1
instances are configured to accept dump-getting and dump-setting
requests from your client.
Refer to
.Xr s6-fdholderd 1
for details.
.Pp
A typical use case of
.Nm
is when the main fd-holding daemon needs to upgrade, or restart for
some reason.
Transferring the file descriptors into another, temporary, fd-holding
daemon instance allows it to restart without losing the descriptors.

Communications with the servers should be near-instant, so this option
is only here to protect users against programming errors (connecting
to the wrong socket, for instance).
