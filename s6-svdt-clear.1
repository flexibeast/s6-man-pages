.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm s6-svdt-clear
.Nd clear the recorded death tally of a service.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar servicedir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
clears the recorded death tally of the service being currently
supervised at the
.Ar servicedir
service directory.
.Sh NOTES
Use of
.Nm
impacts the listings obtained by the
.Xr s6-svdt 1
command.
.Pp
It also impacts the behaviour of the
.Xr s6-permafailon 1
command. This is the main reason to use
.Nm :
once a service has failed permanently due to an excessive number of
deaths in a given time, it can be useful to erase that record of
deaths before starting the service again, in order to avoid
permanently failing again too fast.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Bl -tag -width x
.It 0
Success.
.It 100
Wrong usage.
.It 111
System call failed.
