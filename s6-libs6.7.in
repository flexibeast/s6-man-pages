.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm s6-libs6
.Nd collection of utility C interfaces, used in the s6 executables
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Compiling
Make sure the s6 headers, as well as the skalibs headers, are visible
in your header search path.
.Pp
Use
.Ql #include <s6/s6.h> .
.Ss Linking
Make sure the s6 libraries, as well as the skalibs libraries, are
visible in your library search path.
.Pp
Link against
.Ql -ls6
and
.Ql -lskarnet .
If you're using socket functions (which is the case with
.Xr s6-ftrigr 7 ,
for instance), add
.Ql `cat $sysdeps/socket.lib`
to your command line.
If you're using timed functions involving TAI timestamps (which is
also the case with
.Xr s6-ftrigr 7 ,
for instance), add
.Ql `cat $sysdeps/sysclock.lib` .
.Qq $sysdeps
stands for your skalibs sysdeps directory.
.Ss Programming
The
.Pa s6/s6.h
header is actually a concatenation of other headers: libs6 is
separated into several modules, each of them with its own header.

.It
The
.Pa s6/accessrules.h
header provides functions to check credentials against configuration
files.
.It
The
.Pa s6/ftrigr.h
header provides functions to subscribe to
.Xr s6-fifodir 7 Ns s
and be notified of events.
.It
The
.Pa s6/ftrigw.h
header provides functions to manage
.Xr s6-fifodir 7 Ns s
and send notifications to them.
.It
The
.Pa s6/s6lock.h
header provides functions to acquire locks with a timeout.
.It
The
.Pa s6/s6-fdholder.h
header provides functions to communicate with an
.Xr s6-fdholderd 1
server and exchange file descriptors with it.
