.Xr s6-fifodir 7 .
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar fifodir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
cleans up
.Ar fifodir ,
that must belong to the current user. That means it removes all stale
FIFOs in
.Ar fifodir .
.Pp
In normal use, it is not necessary to call
.Nm .
However, stale FIFOs can be left by
.Xr s6-ftrigrd 1
processes that were violently killed, so it's good practice to
regularly clean up fifodirs.
