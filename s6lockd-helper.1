.Sh NAME
.Nm s6lockd-helper
.Nd helper program for the
.Xr s6lockd 1
daemon.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
just acquires a lock and holds it until it is killed or told to exit
by its parent daemon.
.Nm
is not meant to be invoked directly by the user: it will be spawned by
the
.Xr s6lockd 1
program.
.Pp
.Nm
blocks on lock acquisition until it succeeds. It then notifies its
parent. It exits when its parent tells it to (i.e. when the client
asks for lock release). During the lock acquisition phase, it can be
killed if its parent detects a timeout.
.Pp
One
.Nm
process per lock is the only way (apart from threads) to implement
timed lock acquisition. This can lead to a lot of
.Nm
processes, but this is not a problem:

Processes are not a scarce resource. Today's schedulers work in O(1),
or in O(a function of the number of runnable processes), which means
that a sleeping process takes no scheduling time at all.
.It
.Nm
is extremely tiny. Every instance should use up at most one or two
pages of non-sharable memory.
